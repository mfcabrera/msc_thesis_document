The previous chapters introduced the concepts and related work  in the fields
of  \ac{NLP}, \ac{NNLM} and vector representation of words. This chapter will
focus on the application of a particular model, namely \textit{Word2Vec}, to
the German language.  

% There art two main reasons that justify the study of the behavior of word
% vector representation in a language as morphologically rich and  inflective
% as German.

Although that  evidence that word vector representation might work
well in other languages other than English has been presented
\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/MikolovLS13}, to the date  there are not in depth studies or empirical evaluations of the
performance of word representation for such languages,  in similar or equivalent tasks as the
ones performed by \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1301-3781} for the English
language. 

Previous work has shown that  n-gram backoff language models, the state of the art
technique, does not perform  as well for inflectional  languages as they work
for English \cite{conf/icassp/MikolovKBGC09}.  Previous work also shows that
\ac{NNLM} captures  better the complexity of such languages
\cite{conf/icassp/MikolovKBGC09}\cite{DBLP:journals/corr/MikolovLS13},
therefore  is possible that word vectors generated by such model  will 
improve  and simply many \ac{NLP} applications in
these languages as they have been shown to do in
English \cite{collobert:2008} \cite{Turian:2010:WRS:1858681.1858721}.  This makes therefore an initial evaluation of the quality of the word vector
attractive.

The rest of the chapter is divided as follows: The first part described the
selected tasks, the rationale behind the adaption made to fit the German
language and the data set  and the different preprocessing alternatives we
tried. The second part described the training approach as well describe the most
important result of our approach.

%  In this chapter we will
% describe a set of tasks adapted from \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1301-3781}
% to better match the characteristics of German language. In addition we will
% compare  the performance with English language.

\section{Task Description}


In their original paper \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1301-3781} the authors
introduced a comprehensive test that contained five types of semantic
questions. In the original data set  there were 8869 semantic and 10675
syntactic questions. To create this set the authors compiled a list of
similar word pairs manually and then they generated the list by
connecting the word pairs. Table~\ref{tab:task_original_en} shows examples 
examples from each category of tasks. 

To evaluate the quality of the word vectors the question  are answer in the
following manner: given the word pairs ($a$, $b$) and ($c$, $d$) a question
is considered to be answered correctly if the for resulting vector $X$ the closest vector measured in
cosine similarity is  $vector(d)$. $X$ is calculated by applying the following
operation $X = vector(b) - vector(a) + vector(c)$.  

 For example  for the words
($``small''$, $''smaller''$ ) and ($''big''$ ,$"bigger"$),
the $vector("bigger")$ should be the closest to the resulting
vector $X$. If the representation of the word in
vector space is good, then it is possible to find the answer using such
operation \cite{DBLP:journals/corr/abs-1301-3781}.

As discussed in the first part of this work, the word representations
capture different types of  similarities among words. Therefore, with the
operation described above,  what is  being
attempted is to answer the question ``\emph{What is the word that is similar to
c in the same sense as b is similar to a?}''. 

% To compare the quality of different versions of word vectors, previous papers typically use a table
% showing example words and their most similar words, and understand them intuitively. Although
% it is easy to show that word France is similar to Italy and perhaps some other countries, it is much
% more challenging when subjecting those vectors in a more complex similarity task, as follows. We
% follow previous observation that there can be many different types of similarities between words, for
% example, word big is similar to bigger in the same sense that small is similar to smaller. Example
% of another type of relationship can be word pairs big - biggest and small - smallest [20]. We further
% denote two pairs of words with the same relationship as a question, as we can ask: ”What is the
% word that is similar to small in the same sense as biggest is similar to big?”

In order to evaluate the performance of the word vectors in the same way but in other language a
similar set of questions  needs to be created. Two approaches might be used
to accomplish this. The words can be translated, either automatically or by hand, or the data set can be
generated from scratch in a similar manner as the original was.  In this work
the translation was performed by hand using a German - English online dictionary \footnote{http://dict.cc} as guide and
verified by two native speakers.

Regardless of the method chosen, some tasks of this set are biased towards
the morphology of English and could not be easily mapped to another language,
and in particular to German. Therefore a simple translation would not be
enough to obtain a equivalent task set for another language. For that reason
each of the original 14 tasks was analyzed to either adapt it to German or
discard it completely.

\section{Adapting the tasks to the German Language}
\label{sec:adapt_task_german_lang}

Many of  tasks from the original  Semantic Syntactic set of task are language
dependent. In order to adapt them  to the German language  each of different
types of question was evaluated. Some of them can be easily adapted to German
just by translating the respective word. However, some of the them either do
not make sense for German in from the morphology point of view or do not
apply for German. From the original 14 types of questions, the German version only
10 and equivalent set was also constructed for English for performing the
comparison. Below each of the tasks are described in detail along with what
was done to adapt it to German when possible.

\subsection{Common Capital and City and All Capital}
\label{sec:sub_sec_common_capital_country}

This group of question try to solve analogies between country and capitals.
The vector model is asked the semantic relationship \emph{Capital Country}.
For example:  ``\emph{What is the word that is similar to
Germany in the same sense as Paris is similar to France?}''. The model should
answer then the word produce a vector close to ``\emph{Berlin}''. The
difference between the two subsets is that common capital contains
 the 22 most ``\textit{common}'' country - capital word pairs. However the
 criteria for the selection is not defined by the authors of the set. The
 other subset contains country - capital pairs of less known countries such
 as \textit{Ghana  -  Accra} and  \textit{Harare -  Zimbabwe}.

For this task the adaptation was done by simply translating the names from
the English ones to their German counterparts. 

\subsection{Currency}
\label{sec:sub_sec_currency}
For the currency section all of the pairs were translated using the wikipedia
as source for the information. 

\subsection{City in State}
\label{sec:sub_sec_city_in_state}
This group of questions try evaluate the semantic relationship between a city
and a state for cities in the United States of America.  However, the
objective of the experiment is to have a standard,  almost
language independent comparable test set for the word vectors generated by \textit{Word2Vec}, tasks that
are centered in information mostly found in a specific language are not relevant and
will not provide good information about the quality of the vectors. For this
reason the complete tasks group was  removed from the dataset. An alternative could have been to replace it with a similar
tasks (e.g. using cities in Germany / Austria). In this case however,  a
comparisson with another language would have been impossible as the
information sources might not contain that information or even the word
themselves.

\subsection{Man-Woman}
\label{sec:sub_sec_man_woman}
This tasks try to evaluate the semantic relationship between words associated
with men and women. For this tasks the equivalent German version of the word
were used for validation a  online German - English dictionary was used.

\subsection{Adjective to Adverb}
\label{sec:sub_sec_adjetive_adverb}
This task models the relationship between an adjective and its correspondent
adverb. However in German this does not make sense, because unlike English,
German does not make a distinction in form between a predicate adjective and
an adverb \cite{durrell2011hammer}. For example in English:

\begin{itemize}
\item The man is quiet. (quiet = adjective)
\item The man sings quietly. (quietly = adverb)
\end{itemize}

Whereas a German speaker would say:

\begin{itemize}
\item Der Mann ist leise. (leise = adjective)
\item Der Mann singt leise. (leise = adverb)
\end{itemize}

For this reason the trained word vector will not be able to differentiate the
roles. Thus, this tasks is removed from the set. 

\subsection{Opposite}
\label{sec:sub_sec_opposite}
This task try to model the \emph{opposite} semantic relationship between words.
Although it may seem relatively easy to adapt this task to German there
things that need to bee taken into account. In German,  not necessarily the
most common ``antonym'' is used nor they have a regulara morphological
structure as in English. For example  in English is usual to form the
opposite by adding the prefix \textit{in} ,  \textit{un} , \textit{im} or
\textit{dis}. In fact, all of the word pairs that appear in the English
version of this set are formed in such way. This is not always true in
German. For example, the opposite for the word  \textit{\"{u}berzeugend} (roughly
translating to \emph{convincing} in English) has not opposite in that form.
The only way to form the opposite is by adding the negation, e.g.
\textit{nicht  \"{u}berzeugend }. Another example would be the pair
\textit{geschmackvoll} - \textit{ geschmacklos}, which are as well opposites,
but where the suffix is the difference.
However, most of the word in these tasks could be also build in a similar
fashion as in the English set, therefore we adapt this task by looking for
the best translations that can be formed with common structure.

\subsection{Comparative and Superlative}
\label{sec:sub_sec_comparative_sup}

The comparative task  try to model to evaluate the syntactic relationship between a word
and its comparative form, for example the word pairs  \textit{young} and
\textit{younger}. Respectively the superlative task aims to evaluate the
superlative relationship  (e.g. \textit{safe}  and \textit{safest}). 

Many of the words belonging to this data set can be easily translated to
German directly. However, there are some caveats. First, English have many
more words for representing the same semantic concept than German.  English is language from
the family of Germanic languages, therefore shares the common structure
and grammar. However, many words have been borrowed from Latin, expanding the
vocabulary  and in many cases replacing the words from Germanic origin. 
For example, the word \textit{tall}  comes from Old Germanic and  the
word \textit{large} comes from Latin. Both words could be translated to
German as \textit{hoch}. However, the English word  \textit{high} of German
origin can also be translated as \textit{hoch}.
% Another example of this is the German the word  \textit{gross}, that represents
% the quality  of being  \textit{big}, but also \textit{large} or \textit{tall}.
That is a unique concept in German can represent many things in English. 
Give this, only one word is maintained in German and one English representing
the same concept making the number of pairs equivalent.


% To measure quality of the word vectors, we  a comprehensive test set that contains ﬁve types
% of semantic questions, and nine types of syntactic questions. Two examples from each category are
%
\subsection{Present Participle}
\label{sec:sub_sec_present_participle}

This tasks try to model the relationship between verbs and its participle
(e.g. \textit{come} -\textit{coming}). In English is used the participle in
much more ways than German: 

\begin{itemize}
\item  To form the progressive (continuous) aspect: Jim was sleeping. as an
  adjective phrase modifying a noun phrase: The man sitting over there is my
  uncle.
\item adverbially, the subject being understood to be the same as that
  of the main clause: Looking at the plans, I gradually came to see where the
  problem lay.
\item  similarly, but with a different subject, placed before the
  participle (the nominative absolute construction): He and I having
  reconciled our differences, the project then proceeded smoothly.
\item more
  generally as a clause or sentence modifier: Broadly speaking, the project
  was successful.

\end{itemize}

In German, unlike English  the present participle is used almost exclusively as an
adjective or adverb and as such are inflected. This is imply that in a model
such as  \textit{Word2Vec} the same word after the declension will be
represented with different words. For the purpose of this tasks, this mean
the is expected to have low number of correct answer.

\subsection{Nationality Adjective and  Plural nouns}
\label{sec:sub_sec_nat_plu}

The nationality adjective tasks model the relationship between a country and
the the adjective representing the nationality. For example, for the word
\textit{Colombia}, the respective adjective is \textit{Colombian}. In German,
the nationality is also an adjective, and as such is inflected based on the
case and genus of the substantive. Similar to the participle, many words will
represent the same concept, thus low correct answer rate are expected in this
task.  For this task the corresponding German adjective with no inflection is  used.

The plural nouns task model the relationship of a word and its plural the
proportion of words that are the same plural is higher than English. This is
a factor that will affect the test because the same word is never taken as a
valid answer. [REFERENCE?] 


\subsection{Past Tense and Plural Verbs}
\label{sec:sub_sec_plural_verbs}
The two task find syntantic relationship between verbs and they past tense
and the conjugation respectively. This relationships does not hold in German,
and therefore are removed from the test.
