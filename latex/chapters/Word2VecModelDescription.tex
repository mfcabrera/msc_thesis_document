\subsection{Huffman Coding}
\label{sec:huffman_coding}

Huffman coding is an entropy  encoding algorithm used for lossless data
compression.  It was developed by David A. Huffman while he was a Ph.D.
student at MIT. \cite{huf52}.

Huffan cioding is an algorithm to proce an  optimal symbol code $C$ for a given 
\emph{pmf} $ p = (p_1,....,p_n) $.  Huffman coding builds a tree orderded by frequency.
