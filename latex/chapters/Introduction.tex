From the early days of computers, people have dreamed about machines with intelligence. Computer able to exhibit complex behaviour and able to solve tasks assigned by users.


% From the first day of existence of the computers, people were dreaming about artificial intelligence - machines that would produce complex behaviour to reach goals specified by human users. Possibility of existence of such machines has been controversial, and many philosophical questions were raised - whether the intelligence is not unique only to humans, or only to animals etc. Very influential work of Alan Turing did show that any computable problem can be computed by Universal Turing Machine - thus, assuming that the human mind can be described by some algorithm, Turing Machine is powerful enough to represent it.
% Computers today are Turing-complete, ie. can represent any computable algorithm. Thus, the main problem is how to find configuration of the machine so that it would produce desired behaviour that humans consider intelligent. Assuming that the problem is too difficult to be solved immediately, we can think of several ways that would lead us towards intelligent machines - we can start with a simple machine that can recognize basic shapes and images such as written digits, then scale it towards more complex types of images such as human faces and so on, finally reaching machine that can recognize objects in the real world as well as humans can.
% Other possible way can be to simulate parts of the human brain on the level of indi- vidual brain cells, neurons. Computers today are capable of realistically simulating the real world, as can be seen in modern computer games - thus, it seems logical that with accurate simulation of neurons and more computational power, it should be possible to simulate the whole human brain one day.

\section{Motivation and Objectives}
\label{sec:motivation}
- natural language and therefore word vector embeddings model has been mostly evalutated using english as the basic language
- how these perform on toher languages other than english with more complex grammar and sytax is nonethelss important.

- word2vec has shown to generate interesting word vector maininigting linear relationships. However, up to this date no applications of these word vector model besides some experiments with translation. 
- This word explores a previous approach to document classificaion using word word vectors but with two particularities. One the exsitince of an already classifier based on handcrafted features, second the language of work is German, that is a highly inflective language.
