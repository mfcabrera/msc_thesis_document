\section{Word2vec for Document Classification of German language business document}
\label{sec:rel_word2vec_doc_classification}

% Introduction 
%  - Promises of deep learning
%  - Help many task
%  - Document classification is an interesting problem because there is a
%  standard methdology to use word vector representation
%  Structure of the chapter
%  Gini document infraestructure (qucik description of Count Dooku)
%  Gini dataset and document classification dataset.
%  Description of the current implementation
%  BoW word model
%  Word2Vec document mean vector representation
%  Comparisson of the model
%  Different Feature visualization
%  Conclusion and Future work.
%   - Using individual features will make always hard to work with variable
%   - Sized documents - that is definitive.
